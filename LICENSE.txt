The source code files in this directory implement as tightly as
possible algorithms described in this IPOL article. They are made
available to the exclusive aim of serving as scientific tools enabling
the verification of the soundness and completeness of the algorithmic
descriptions.

These source codes implement an algorithm possibly linked to the patent
[1][2]. Compiling or running this code may violate patents in certain
countries. For this reason, the use of the source files
- demo_ASIFT.cpp
- compute_asift_keypoints.cpp
- compute_asift_matches.cpp
- demo_lib_sift.cpp
may be restricted in certain countries to non profit research and non profit
educational purposes. In certain countries, redistribution or commercial
use of these source files may require the  consent of the patent owner.

In short, be careful before you download, compile, use, modify, or
redistribute these source codes. The situation being different for every
country and changing over time, it is your responsibility to check that
you are not infringing a patent by using this source code. IPOL therefore
invites potential users to consult a patent lawyer. If and only if you are
free from any patent restriction, then you can enjoy the BSD license terms.

The source code in the subdirectory third_party comes from the Eigen
library, which is LGPL-licensed.
